Distribution of CLV and Adjusted CLV:
The CLV distribution shows a wide range from 0 to 25,000, with most customers in the lower ranges (0-5,000). A long tail indicates a small group of high-value customers. Multiple peaks suggest distinct customer segments. The difference between CLV and Adjusted CLV implies consideration of factors like acquisition costs. This distribution offers opportunities for targeted marketing and strategies to increase customer value over time.

Customer Lifetime Value Segments:
The segmentation reveals a typical value pyramid: Low_Value (61.3%), Mid_Value (35.8%), and High-Value (2.8%). This structure highlights the importance of the small high-value group, likely contributing significantly to revenue. The large low-value segment presents opportunities for value improvement, while the mid-value segment offers potential for upward transition. This segmentation suggests the need for tailored retention, marketing, and service strategies for each group to optimize overall customer lifetime value.
